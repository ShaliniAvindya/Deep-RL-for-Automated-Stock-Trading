# Deep-RL-for-Automated-Stock-Trading
Deep Reinforcement Learning methods for facilitating Automated Stock Trading.

This project implements a Stock Trading Bot, trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Implementation is kept simple, Stable baselines has been used for implementation of RL algorithms.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.


#Stable-Baselines

Stable Baselines is a set of improved implementations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms based on OpenAI Baselines.

On each learning step, we update both the Actor parameter (with policy gradients and advantage value), and the Critic parameter (with minimizing the mean squared error with the Bellman update equation)

# Data
You can download Historical Financial data from www.Marketwatch.com for training. We have used data of Apple and DogeCoin for Training.
